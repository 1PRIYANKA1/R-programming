//Create a C++ class Vector with data members size & pointer to integer. The size of the 
//vector varies so the memory should be allocated dynamically.
//Perform following operations:
//I.	Accept a vector
//II.	Display a vector in the format(10,20,30,	)
//III.	Calculate union of two vectors.
//(use parameterized constructor & copy constructor)
